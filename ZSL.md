## Project: ZSL

### Introduction
The following document is for the project involving the Zoological Society of London. Are project called 'Eco-Warriors' follows the instructions given to us. My team consisted of Matthew Kaptur, Codrin axinte, Bec Nash, Oliver Slape, and myself.

Our game will center around four habitats: Countryside, Rainforest, Ocean, Arctic. There was a product associated with each habitat.  Each habitat will have a specific asthetic inkeeping with its unique themes. For countryside we had to cover the unsustainable beef industry. Following that we had bottles for the ocean habitat. The next one was Rainforest, for this one we had mobile phones. Lastly we had electric items being left on and how thats effecting the arctic.

You will begin by choosing a character from a selection of animals native to the four habitats. The players goal is to complete sets of questions which will contribute to the greenhouse chain once completed. As you progress through the game and complete more and more questions the planet will start becoming healthier. This will be represented by a world map that changes state depending on the level of carbon in the atmosphere.

### Game Objective
This documents houses information that is useful for the persons involved. The target audience are 11-12 year olds primarily, with plans of extending it to 11-16, in the future. The app must be engaging, but more importantly informative.

### OverView
ZSL hosted a competition involving multiple educational institutes. They wanted us to compete by designing an educational game for them. Since their is 12 students in are class, we had the opportunity to split into smaller teams of around four. This allowed us to provide ZSL a wider range of selection. 

The incentive of this project was to educate children on the effects of greenhouse gas, and its many origins. We were given a presentation, from an employee of ZSL, on the effects of green house emmisions on the enviroment. How the ice caps are melting, and how wildlife is fairing against temperature changes. ZSL wanted an app that would enlighten children of their impact to our evironment. 

The theme of this game needed to revolve around four habitats. This gives us alot of choice visually, but can be hard to stay consistant. They wanted the recurrent theme to be the greenhouse gas chain. We also needed to build this game to function on an IPAD, as this was what they had in use. 

### Costs
Detailed below are the costs involved in the making of this application:
- The computer systems at college cost £2000 including screens. Multiply that by 5 for all of us and you have £10000.
- Unity pro was the main tool used during development which per person costs £130. So for five of us that would make £650.
- We used Adobe photoshop at college with subscription costs ranging from £15-£40. For all of us its £75-£200. I use it at home aswell and pay £16.50. 
- Microsoft services cost £60 annually. Costing £300 considering they're are five members. 
- We had to pay £26 for assets to create are game UI. These were essential as they saved us loads of time. The assets were nature themed so they also fit in with the aestetic of the game. The assets were bought on shutterstocks.
- There were costs for travel to meetings, also time spent working. 

### Scope
With a limited time span of 5 weeks. We were set the task of creating a engaging educational application. This application was to be used by ZSL in their regular educational sessions with children. We needed to be able to provide a prototype in 2 weeks so had to keep focus only on what was nessecary. After establishing what we were going to do we wanted to stay on track so as to counteract mistakes or changes further down the line.

### Time
After having are first meeting with ZSL, we found out we had 5 weeks to complete the application. We had 2 weeks from the last meeting to come with design documentation. We also had to put together a presentation for are application to show ZSL are ideas and get their input. The next two weeks were spent constructing are application. Week five was dedicated to testing are application and making any final adjustments, and changes. 

### Quality Assurance Preface
To assure to are customer ZSL that we are serious. We will attend all scheduled meetings involving the project. We will listen with consideration to the ideas they have. Remembering that it is their idea, and that we have been employed to help see it created. We will regularly test are game and improve upon it where possible. We will eventually present a prototype of are game that will be presented to a panel of judges of ZSL. After this if we're selected to continue working on are game we will set a deadline and aim to have a functional product that meets the criteria set by ZSL.

### Communication
#### Within Team
Communication was integral during this project. Are main concern being that we would be doing the same jobs, and wasting valuable time. We always respected new ideas and heard them out giving constructive feedback. We later found this benefited are team being able to honestly evaluate eachothers work. We used are computers primarily to contact eachother via facebook, and used voice chat. Mobile phones are a necessity, its very important that you can be reached when needed.
#### With ZSL
During are meetings with ZSL we acted proffesionally listening to what Michelle wanted. We exchanged ideas but tryed to keep it focused on theirs. We had open communication with Michelle throughout via email. We were free to ask about subjects relevant to the project, and to bounce ideas back and forth.    

### Risk
Reboot games is a brand new company. Which means we haven't had a chance to build our reputation. The risk is making a bad impression while working with an organisation such as ZSL. Are goal was to build a rapport with them so there would be a greater chance of them considering us in the future. We will conduct ourselves professionally by arriving to meetings keeping communication with ZSL throughout the process of building the application.

### Resources
We used a variety of tools during the development of this app. We used multiple services which included: Unity, Photoshop, GitHub, and PowerPoint. We also had access to computers, ipads. online resources were also available such as shutterstock. Which we used to get the applications UI.

### Goals and Team Roles
The goal of this project is to create a game centered around the greenhouse chain. The game must be informative, and engaging for young adults. It must follow a storybook style showing you different stages of the greenhouse chain in relative detail. All information must be factual and relevant to each of the four habitats.

- We will begin by planning what we're going to do. We will do this by creating flowcharts, and conceptual mock-ups of are game. This will give us an idea of what are game will look like, and how to code it. We needed to have a presentation completed detailing are game and ideas for ZSL by october time. 

- The final presentation is to be attended by all members of the team. This is because of the importance of the event. Their will be a succesful developer on the panel, making this a potential opportunity.

### Tools and Techniques
Tools -
Photoshop -
We used Photoshop to create are 4 habitat backgrounds. Which saved us money instead of buying them from a web source which can be expensive. We also used Photoshop to create the maze in are first prototype of our game. Photoshop was also used to create the greenhouse gas meter on the right hand side

Github -
As a group we used GitHub a lot to trade documentation between all of us as when we were not in class it was harder to send work to each other and we also used it to keep a backup every one uploaded work there and when a certain person needed something they knew where to go. We also used it to make a glossary for the finished ZSL project where we had all are finished documentation

Unity -
We used Unity to create are application. We figured unity was the best to use as a group of 4 we could all work on it at the same time and then upload it for each other so we could complete it faster. It was also easy to use and had a lot of assists which we used as we were only starting out on the program.

Power Point -
We used Power Point for are presentations, first when she came in to see are ideas and concept designs we made a short presentation to show off the ideas so it was easy for her to see what are ideas where. We also used Power Point to present are final game to them when we went to Whipsnade zoo. We showed are finished design and how we adapted to feed back. The reason we used Power Point was that it is the simplest and best presentation software out there. We also used Power Point online so all four of us could work on different slides for the certain parts of work that each person did.

Techniques -
Interviews -
We had multiple interviews with ZSL. The first one was when Michelle came in to tell us about the project and what she wants at the end of it. We all took notes so that we could get more information from what she was saying as well as off the Power Point she had. The other Interview we did was when we were at ZSL presenting are final game.

Prototyping -
We used prototyping when was creating are game in Unity we tested everything after doing sections of code and saving backups all the time. We also loaded up separate Unity programs to test certain parts to see if each part was working so if we had a problem when we put it together it would be easier to find the problem

Presentations -
We presented are game in a presentation as it is easy to get your points across and it captures people’s attention when you are standing at the front of the room and have your presentation behind you. You can also use your body language and speaking skills to help present your work and get it across

### Problems encountered
The main issue we faced when starting this project was how we were going to develop a game that was compatible with IOS. Are concern was that we didnt have access to the IOS platform. This was quickly resolved as are college was willing to loan us multiple IPAD's for testing. This helped immensly as we could test the functionality before presenting.

Another issue we faced was the incorporation of animations into Unity. We found a fix for this by creating them in Adobe Flash Pro, and then converting them using GAF. GAF takes SWF files and converts them to the Unity compatible GAF files. This made the process of creating animations for are game much easier saving us alot of time for more important tasks.
