## Project: ZSL

### Introduction
The following document is for the project involving the Zoological Society of London. Are project called 'Eco-Warriors' follows the instructions given to us. My team consisted of Matthew Kaptur, Codrin axinte, Bec Nash, Oliver Slape, and myself. 

### OverView
ZSL hosted a competition involving multiple educational institutes. They wanted us to compete by designing an educational game for them. Since their is 12 students in are class, we had the opportunity to split into smaller teams of around four. This allowed us to provide ZSL a wider range of selection. 

The incentive of this project was to educate children on the effects of greenhouse gas, and its many origins. We were given a presentation, from an employee of ZSL, on the effects of green house emmisions on the enviroment. How the ice caps are melting, and how wildlife is fairing against temperature changes. ZSL wanted an app that would enlighten children of their impact to our evironment. 

The theme of this game needed to revolve around four habitats. This gives us alot of choice visually, but can be hard to stay consistant. They wanted the recurrent theme to be the greenhouse gas chain. We also needed to build this game to function on an IPAD, as this was what they had in use. 

### Scope
This documents houses information that is useful for the persons involved. The target audience are 11-12 year olds primarily, with plans of extending it to 11-16, in the future. The app must be engaging, but more importantly informative.

### Time


We had 5 weeks Michelle came in to pitch the idea.
2 weeks to complete all of the required design documentation
2 weeks we also needed to complete a proposal to demonstrate and show the client our idea
The 3rd and 4th week were used for the development and construction of the application
last week was used for testing and finalizing the application


### Quality Assurance Preface
To assure to are customer ZSL that we are serious. We will attend all scheduled meetings involving the project. We will listen with consideration to the ideas they have. Remembering that it is their idea, and that we have been employed to help see it created. We will regularly test are game and improve upon it where possible. We will eventually present a prototype of are game that will be presented to a panel of judges of ZSL. After this if we're selected to continue working on are game we will set a deadline and aim to have a functional product that meets the criteria set by ZSL.

### Communication
Communication was integral during this project. Are main concern being that we would be doing the same jobs, and wasting valuable time. We always respected new ideas and heard them out giving constructive feedback. We later found this benefited are team being able to honestly evaluate eachothers work. We used are computers primarily to contact eachother via facebook, and used voice chat. Mobile phones are a necessity, its very important that you can be reached when needed.

### Risk
Reboot games is a brand new company. Which means we haven't had a chance to build our reputation. The risk is making a bad impression while working with an organisation such as ZSL

### Resources
We used a variety of tools during the development of this app. We used multiple services which included: Unity, Photoshop, GitHub, and PowerPoint. We also had access to computers, ipads. online resources were also available such as shutterstock. Which we used to get the applications UI.

### Goals and Team Roles
The goal of this project is to create a game centered around the greenhouse chain. The game must be informative, and engaging for young adults. It must follow a storybook style showing you different stages of the greenhouse chain in relative detail. All information must be factual and relevant to each of the four habitats.

- We will begin by planning what we're going to do. We will do this by creating flowcharts, and conceptual mock-ups of are game. This will give us an idea of what are game will look like, and how to code it. We needed to have a presentation completed detailing are game and ideas for ZSL by october time. 

- The final presentation is to be attended by all members of the team. This is because of the importance of the event. Their will be a succesful developer on the panel, making this a potential opportunity.

### Team Roles
Daniel Edson: Project Design, Project Research.
Oliver Slape: Programmer, Project Research.
Codrin Axinte: Programmer, Project Research.
Bec Nash: Project Research, Project Documentation.
Matthew Kaptur: Project Management, Project Design, Project Documentation.

### Aims and Objectives
- Create a game on the IOS platform.
- Make game compatible for an IPAD.
- 4 unique habitats have to be included in the game.
- Create a demo of are design and present are ideas to ZSL.

### Costs
We had to pay Â£26 for assets to create are game UI. These were essential as they saved us loads of time. The assets were nature themed so they also fit in with the aestetic of the game. The assets were bought on shutterstocks.

### Problems encountered
The main issue we faced when starting this project was how we were going to develop a game that was compatible with IOS. Are concern was that we didnt have access to the IOS platform. This was quickly resolved as are college was willing to loan us multiple IPAD's for testing. This helped immensly as we could test the functionality before presenting.

Another issue we faced was the incorporation of animations into Unity. We found a fix for this by creating them in Adobe Flash Pro, and then converting them using GAF. GAF takes SWF files and converts them to the Unity compatible GAF files. This made the process of creating animations for are game much easier saving us alot of time for more important tasks.
