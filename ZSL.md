## Project: ZSL

### Introduction
The following document is for the project involving the Zoological Society of London. Are project called 'Eco-Warriors' follows the instructions given to us. My team consisted of Matthew Kaptur, Codrin axinte, Bec Nash, Oliver Slape, and myself.

Our game will center around four habitats: Countryside, Rainforest, Ocean, Arctic. There was a product associated with each habitat.  Each habitat will have a specific asthetic inkeeping with its unique themes. For countryside we had to cover the unsustainable beef industry. Following that we had bottles for the ocean habitat. The next one was Rainforest, for this one we had mobile phones. Lastly we had electric items being left on and how thats effecting the arctic.

You will begin by choosing a character from a selection of animals native to the four habitats. The players goal is to complete sets of questions which will contribute to the greenhouse chain once completed. As you progress through the game and complete more and more questions the planet will start becoming healthier. This will be represented by a world map that changes state depending on the level of carbon in the atmosphere.

### Game Objective
This documents houses information that is useful for the persons involved. The target audience are 11-12 year olds primarily, with plans of extending it to 11-16, in the future. The app must be engaging, but more importantly informative.

### OverView
ZSL hosted a competition involving multiple educational institutes. They wanted us to compete by designing an educational game for them. Since their is 12 students in are class, we had the opportunity to split into smaller teams of around four. This allowed us to provide ZSL a wider range of selection. 

The incentive of this project was to educate children on the effects of greenhouse gas, and its many origins. We were given a presentation, from an employee of ZSL, on the effects of green house emmisions on the enviroment. How the ice caps are melting, and how wildlife is fairing against temperature changes. ZSL wanted an app that would enlighten children of their impact to our evironment. 

The theme of this game needed to revolve around four habitats. This gives us alot of choice visually, but can be hard to stay consistant. They wanted the recurrent theme to be the greenhouse gas chain. We also needed to build this game to function on an IPAD, as this was what they had in use. 

### Project aims:
- To create a fun and educational game.
- To educate students about climate change.
- To make it interactive for the kids to enjoy.
- To raise awareness and how they can help stop climate change.

### User and software Requirements:
- Educational game.
- Interactive game.
- Multi-user.
- Simplistic interface.
- Child friendly.
- Compatible with an IPad.

### Costs
Detailed below are the costs involved in the making of this application:
- The computer systems at college cost £2000 including screens. Multiply that by 5 for all of us and you have £10000.
- Unity pro was the main tool used during development which per person costs £130. So for five of us that would make £650.
- We used Adobe photoshop at college with subscription costs ranging from £15-£40. For all of us its £75-£200. I use it at home aswell and pay £16.50. 
- Microsoft services cost £60 annually. Costing £300 considering they're are five members. 
- We had to pay £26 for assets to create are game UI. These were essential as they saved us loads of time. The assets were nature themed so they also fit in with the aestetic of the game. The assets were bought on shutterstocks.
- There were costs for travel to meetings, also time spent working. 

### Scope
With a limited time span of 5 weeks. We were set the task of creating a engaging educational application. This application was to be used by ZSL in their regular educational sessions with children. We needed to be able to provide a prototype in 2 weeks so had to keep focus only on what was nessecary. After establishing what we were going to do we wanted to stay on track so as to counteract mistakes or changes further down the line.

### Time
After having are first meeting with ZSL, we found out we had 5 weeks to complete the application. We had 2 weeks from the last meeting to come with design documentation. We also had to put together a presentation for are application to show ZSL are ideas and get their input. The next two weeks were spent constructing are application. Week five was dedicated to testing are application and making any final adjustments, and changes. 

### Quality Assurance Preface
To assure to are customer ZSL that we are serious. We will attend all scheduled meetings involving the project. We will listen with consideration to the ideas they have. Remembering that it is their idea, and that we have been employed to help see it created. We will regularly test are game and improve upon it where possible. We will eventually present a prototype of are game that will be presented to a panel of judges of ZSL. After this if we're selected to continue working on are game we will set a deadline and aim to have a functional product that meets the criteria set by ZSL.

### Communication
Within Team - Communication was integral during this project. Are main concern being that we would be doing the same jobs, and wasting valuable time. We always respected new ideas and heard them out giving constructive feedback. We later found this benefited are team being able to honestly evaluate eachothers work. We used are computers primarily to contact eachother via facebook, and used voice chat. Mobile phones are a necessity, its very important that you can be reached when needed.


With ZSL - During are meetings with ZSL we acted proffesionally listening to what Michelle wanted. We exchanged ideas but tryed to keep it focused on theirs. We had open communication with Michelle throughout via email. We were free to ask about subjects relevant to the project, and to bounce ideas back and forth.    

### Risk
Reboot games is a brand new company. Which means we haven't had a chance to build our reputation. The risk is making a bad impression while working with an organisation such as ZSL. Are goal was to build a rapport with them so there would be a greater chance of them considering us in the future. We will conduct ourselves professionally by arriving to meetings keeping communication with ZSL throughout the process of building the application.

### Resources
We used a variety of tools during the development of this app. We used multiple services which included: Unity, Photoshop, GitHub, and PowerPoint. We also had access to computers, ipads. online resources were also available such as shutterstock. Which we used to get the applications UI.

### Team Roles

### Goals and Team Roles
The goal of this project is to create a game centered around the greenhouse chain. The game must be informative, and engaging for young adults. It must follow a storybook style showing you different stages of the greenhouse chain in relative detail. All information must be factual and relevant to each of the four habitats.

- We will begin by planning what we're going to do. We will do this by creating flowcharts, and conceptual mock-ups of are game. This will give us an idea of what are game will look like, and how to code it. We needed to have a presentation completed detailing are game and ideas for ZSL by october time. 

- The final presentation is to be attended by all members of the team. This is because of the importance of the event. Their will be a succesful developer on the panel, making this a potential opportunity.

### Aims and Objectives
- Create a game on the IOS platform.
- Make game compatible for an IPAD.
- 4 unique habitats have to be included in the game.
- Create a demo of are design and present are ideas to ZSL.

### First meeting with ZSL (02/10/17)
After being approched by ZSL we had a meeting with a representative Michelle. Michelle explained what she and her colleagues wanted from this application. She gave us a long talk on our effects to the environment. The talk was very informative and we all got relevant notes.

### What are epics and user stories?
Epics - Epics are what are user wants ultimately. While working with ZSL we were told to make an application to educate children of their carbon footprint. So one epic would be "As a user i want to learn about the effect im having on the environment" The stories are coming from the perspective of the child user and what they want.

User stories - User stories are what the user wants. User stories are what contribute to making an epic. You take your epic and break it down into various user stories relating to your application. From "As a user i want to learn about the effect im having on the environment" you could take for example "As a user i want to see the impact on the enviroment". Another one could be "As a user i want to be able to select from four different habitats".

### Concept Pitch (17/10/17) 
After getting an idea of what we wanted it was time to show our client. A meeting was arranged at ZSL Whipsnade which was fortunately not very far from are college. We put together a powerpoint displaying how far we had come and what are plans were. It contained information about the UI, the Machanics and screenshots of it in action. After finishing are presentation we were given feedback from two associates of ZSL.

#### Feedback
- Don't humanise the animal characters by giving them human clothes.
- Link are application more with the greenhouse chain.
- Have shorter questions as they are not suitable for younger users.
- Loved our UI and liked the idea of seeing the effects on the world map.

We had lost sight of the main task, which was have the greenhouse chain as a central focus. We also had problems with are questions being to complex. Children wouldn't have enough time to complete it in the sessions.

#### Adapting to feedback
- "Don't humanise the animal characters by giving them human clothes." - This was an easy fix since it was purely asthetic we could remove it without risk.
- "Link are application more with the greenhouse chain." - We made are sets of questions directly link to the respected greenhouse gas chain.
- "Have shorter questions as they are not suitable for younger users." - We re-visited are questions and edited, or replaced them to be more user friendly.

### Research
Michelle provided us with a wealth of information regarding the subject matter. We were given lists of animals native to the habitats involved. We were given a talk on climate change and the effect we have, however small, on are planet. This talk provided us with a greater understanding of the subject matter. We were also sent documentation detailing the greenhouse chain.

### Tools and Techniques
#### Tools
Adobe flash - We used to this to create animations for are application. We found a way of converting them to an acceptable format for unity. 

Photoshop - We used photoshop to edit pictures and assets for are application. We also created the UI, and the characters using it.

Github - We kept a record of are work on Github and update it regularly with information regarding our product.

Unity - Unity was our design tool to create the game. This software was essential as it let of save are project to a cloud to be accessed by all are team members.

Power Point - We used powerpoint to exhibit are game twice to ZSL. It's very simple to work with and allows you to produce a professional presentation.   

#### Techniques
Interviews - We had two interviews with ZSL. The first took place in our college where we were given a talk on climate change. We wrote relevant notes down for future reference and listened to user requirements. The second meeting took place in ZSL whipsnade. We had to show are progress to Michelle and her colleague. After are presentation we had to discuss what may need to change. This was an important time. This being because we wouldnt get face-to-face feedback again until we presented the final product. This meant it was very important to listen to the client closely, and make sure we were still on track.

Prototyping - We created prototype of are game and tested them for bugs on unity. We wanted to make are game fluid and user friendly. To do this we had to make are application functional. We suffered from start up issues and slow speeds. But we weren't able to rectify these problems in time.

Presentations - When presenting your work its important to maintain eye contact with your audience. You want to smile and project your voice just enough that everyone can clearly hear what your saying. It's important to revise what you will be covering during the presentation so that you dont stumble during. Your audience will pick up on your body language so it's important to be relaxed.

### Importance of team dynamics in the success and/or failure of group work


### Problems encountered
The main issue we faced when starting this project was how we were going to develop a game that was compatible with IOS. Are concern was that we didnt have access to the IOS platform. This was quickly resolved as are college was willing to loan us multiple IPAD's for testing. This helped immensly as we could test the functionality before presenting.

Another issue we faced was the incorporation of animations into Unity. We found a fix for this by creating them in Adobe Flash Pro, and then converting them using GAF. GAF takes SWF files and converts them to the Unity compatible GAF files. This made the process of creating animations for are game much easier saving us alot of time for more important tasks.
