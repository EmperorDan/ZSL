## Project: ZSL

### Introduction
The following document is for the project involving the Zoological Society of London. Are project called 'Eco-Warriors' follows the instructions given to us. My team consisted of Matthew Kaptur, Codrin axinte, Bec Nash, Oliver Slape, and myself.

Our game will center around four habitats: Countryside, Rainforest, Ocean, Arctic. There was a product associated with each habitat.  Each habitat will have a specific asthetic inkeeping with its unique themes. For countryside we had to cover the unsustainable beef industry. Following that we had bottles for the ocean habitat. The next one was Rainforest, for this one we had mobile phones. Lastly we had electric items being left on and how thats effecting the arctic.

The players goal is to complete sets of questions which will contribute to the greenhouse chain once completed. As you progress through the game and complete more and more questions the planet will start becoming healthier. This will be represented by a world map that changes state depending on the level of carbon in the atmosphere.

### Game Objective
This documents houses information that is useful for the persons involved. The target audience are 11-12 year olds primarily, with plans of extending it to 11-16, in the future. The app must be engaging, but more importantly informative.

### OverView
ZSL hosted a competition involving multiple educational institutes. They wanted us to compete by designing an educational game for them. Since their is 12 students in are class, we had the opportunity to split into smaller teams of around four. This allowed us to provide ZSL a wider range of selection. 

The incentive of this project was to educate children on the effects of greenhouse gas, and its many origins. We were given a presentation, from an employee of ZSL, on the effects of green house emmisions on the enviroment. How the ice caps are melting, and how wildlife is fairing against temperature changes. ZSL wanted an app that would enlighten children of their impact to our evironment. 

The theme of this game needed to revolve around four habitats. This gives us alot of choice visually, but can be hard to stay consistant. They wanted the recurrent theme to be the greenhouse gas chain. We also needed to build this game to function on an IPAD, as this was what they had in use. 

### Scope
With a limited time span of 5 weeks. We were set the task of creating a engaging educational application. This application was to be used by ZSL in their regular educational sessions with children. We needed to be able to provide a prototype in 2 weeks so had to keep focus only on what was nessecary. After establishing what we were going to do we wanted to stay on track so as to counteract mistakes or changes further down the line.

### Time
After having are first meeting with ZSL, we found out we had 5 weeks to complete the application. We had 2 weeks from the last meeting to come with design documentation. We also had to put together a presentation for are application to show ZSL are ideas and get their input. The next two weeks were spent constructing are application. Week five was dedicated to testing are application and making any final adjustments, and changes. 

### Quality Assurance Preface
To assure to are customer ZSL that we are serious. We will attend all scheduled meetings involving the project. We will listen with consideration to the ideas they have. Remembering that it is their idea, and that we have been employed to help see it created. We will regularly test are game and improve upon it where possible. We will eventually present a prototype of are game that will be presented to a panel of judges of ZSL. After this if we're selected to continue working on are game we will set a deadline and aim to have a functional product that meets the criteria set by ZSL.

### Communication
#### Within Team
Communication was integral during this project. Are main concern being that we would be doing the same jobs, and wasting valuable time. We always respected new ideas and heard them out giving constructive feedback. We later found this benefited are team being able to honestly evaluate eachothers work. We used are computers primarily to contact eachother via facebook, and used voice chat. Mobile phones are a necessity, its very important that you can be reached when needed.

#### With ZSL
During are meetings with ZSL we acted proffesionally listening to what Michelle wanted. We exchanged ideas but tryed to keep it focused on theirs. We had open communication with Michelle throughout via email. We were free to ask about subjects relevant to the project, and to bounce ideas back and forth.    


### Risk
Reboot games is a brand new company. Which means we haven't had a chance to build our reputation. The risk is making a bad impression while working with an organisation such as ZSL. Are goal was to build a rapport with them so there would be a greater chance of them considering us in the future. We will conduct ourselves professionally by arriving to meetings keeping communication with ZSL throughout the process of building the application.

### Resources
We used a variety of tools during the development of this app. We used multiple services which included: Unity, Photoshop, GitHub, and PowerPoint. We also had access to computers, ipads. online resources were also available such as shutterstock. Which we used to get the applications UI.

### Goals and Team Roles
The goal of this project is to create a game centered around the greenhouse chain. The game must be informative, and engaging for young adults. It must follow a storybook style showing you different stages of the greenhouse chain in relative detail. All information must be factual and relevant to each of the four habitats.

- We will begin by planning what we're going to do. We will do this by creating flowcharts, and conceptual mock-ups of are game. This will give us an idea of what are game will look like, and how to code it. We needed to have a presentation completed detailing are game and ideas for ZSL by october time. 

- The final presentation is to be attended by all members of the team. This is because of the importance of the event. Their will be a succesful developer on the panel, making this a potential opportunity.

### Team Roles
Daniel Edson: Project Design, Project Research.
Oliver Slape: Programmer, Project Research.
Codrin Axinte: Programmer, Project Research.
Bec Nash: Project Research, Project Documentation.
Matthew Kaptur: Project Management, Project Design, Project Documentation.

### Aims and Objectives
- Create a game on the IOS platform.
- Make game compatible for an IPAD.
- 4 unique habitats have to be included in the game.
- Create a demo of are design and present are ideas to ZSL.

### Costs
We had to pay Â£26 for assets to create are game UI. These were essential as they saved us loads of time. The assets were nature themed so they also fit in with the aestetic of the game. The assets were bought on shutterstocks.

### First meeting with ZSL (02/10/17)
After being approched by ZSL we had a meeting with a representative Michelle. Michelle explained

### Problems encountered
The main issue we faced when starting this project was how we were going to develop a game that was compatible with IOS. Are concern was that we didnt have access to the IOS platform. This was quickly resolved as are college was willing to loan us multiple IPAD's for testing. This helped immensly as we could test the functionality before presenting.

Another issue we faced was the incorporation of animations into Unity. We found a fix for this by creating them in Adobe Flash Pro, and then converting them using GAF. GAF takes SWF files and converts them to the Unity compatible GAF files. This made the process of creating animations for are game much easier saving us alot of time for more important tasks.
