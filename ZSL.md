## Project: ZSL

### Introduction
The following document is for the project involving the Zoological Society of London. Are project called 'Eco-Warriors' follows the instructions given to us. My team consisted of Matthew Kaptur, Codrin axinte, Bec, Oliver Slape, and myself. 

### Scope
This documents houses information that is useful for the persons involved. The target audience are 11-12 year olds primarily, with plans of extending it to 11-16, in the future. The app must be engaging, but also informative.

### OverView
ZSL hosted a competition involving multiple educational institutes. They wanted us to compete by designing an educational game for them. Since their is 12 students in are class, we had the opportunity to split into smaller teams of around four. This allowed us to provide ZSL a wider range of selection. 

The incentive of this project was to educate children on the effects of greenhouse gas, and its many origins. We were given a presentation, from an employee of ZSL, on the effects of green house emmisions on the enviroment. How the ice caps are melting, and how wildlife is fairing against temperature changes. It became clear the aim was to help children better understand what impact they have.

The theme of this game needed to revolve around four habitats. This gives us alot of choice visually, but can be hard to stay consistant. They wanted the recurrent theme to be the greenhouse gas chain. We also needed to build this game to function on an IPAD, as this was what they had in use.  

### Goals and Team Roles
The goal of this project is to create a game centered around the greenhouse chain. The game must be informative, and engaging for young adults. It must follow a storybook style showing you different stages of the greenhouse chain in relative detail. All information must be factual and relevant to each of the four habitats.

- First off we will need to sit down, and plan what we're going to do. We will do this by creating flowcharts, and conceptual mock-ups of are game. This will give us an idea of what are game will look like, and how to code it. We needed to have a presentation completed detailing are game and ideas for ZSL by october time. 

- The final presentation is to be attended by all members of the team. This is because of the importance of the event. Their will be a succesful developer on the panel, making this a potential opportunity.

### Team Roles
Daniel Edson: Project Design, Project Research.
Oliver Slape: Programmer, Project Research.
Codrin Axinte: Programmer, Project Research.
Bec Nash: Project Research, Project Documentation.
Matthew Kaptur: Project Management, Project Design, Project Documentation.

### Tools
Unity, Photoshop, GitHub, and PowerPoint.

### Aims and Objectives
- Create a game on the IOS platform.
- Make game compatible for an IPAD.
- 4 unique habitats have to be included in the game.
- Create a demo of are design and present are ideas to ZSL.

### Costs
We had to pay Â£26 for assets to create are game UI. These were essential as they saved us loads of time. The assets were nature themed so they also fit in with the aestetic of the game. The assets were brought on shutterstocks.

### Communication
Communication was integral during this project. Are main concern being that we would be doing the same jobs, and wasting valuable time. We always respected new ideas and heard them out giving constructive feedback. We later found this benefited are team being able to honestly evaluate eachothers work. We used are computers primarily to contact eachother via facebook, and used voice chat. Mobile phones were a nessecity, its very important that you can be reached at certain points during the project.
